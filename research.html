											<h2>High school</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I attended Shahid Beheshti high-school is Ahvaz city, Khouzestan province of Iran. This high-school was part of the national origanization for development of exceptional talents (NODET) in Iran. I studied in the "mathematics and physics" major and took the univesity entrance exam accordingly, in which I ranked 1st nation-wide (among more than 150k participants).</p>

												<h3>Evaluating Educational Capabilites of Large Language Models</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In this research, we carefully studied large language models capability to answer exam questions and grade them, given the correct answer. We implemented variety of prompting strategies and designed experiments to have a rigorous analysis. The target of this project is to facilitate use of AI for teachers and professors.
											</p>
											<p>
												This work has been supervised by prof. Antoinne Bosselut and prof. Tanja Kaser, both the EPFL university, as a part of my internship. Paper and a link to project resources will be ready soon.

												<h3>Evaluating 3D Understanding of Large Language Models</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In this research, we designed a pipeline to create an artificial dataset called DiceFlip, which is an extention to the CoinFlip dataset. Language model has to determine what specific side of the dice is facing upwards, after certain amount of rolling. Also the effect of chain-of-though prompting and few-shot learning is studied in this work.

												This research was supervised by Syrielle Montariol, as a part of my internship at NLP lab, EPFL university, led by prof. Antoinne Bosselut. Links to the project resources will be available soon.

												<h3>Continous Pretraingin of LLMs on Medical Data</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In this reseach, we carefully extracted a high-quality medical corpus and finetuned open access large language models in various sizes on that data. At the next step, we aim to instruction-tune the language model to make it able to perform as a medical chatbot.

												<h3>Robustness Analysis of Computer Vision Models</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In this research, we focused on evaluation of the robustness of computer vision models against adversarial attacks. Particulerly, we studied adversarial training and how we can improve it, regarding accuracy and robustness. This reseach is still onging. 
											</p>
											<p>
												This research also has been a part of my bachelorette project. Its supervised by prof. Sajjad Amini.

											<p>
												For the final project of the deep learning course (Fall 2021) we implemented a depth estimation and an object detection pipeline, using Keras, Tensorflow.

											<p>
												This project was done in collaboration with my friend, Mahyar Jafari. <a href="https://github.com/mahyarjn/DeepLearnong_Project" target="_blank"> Here </a> is a link to this project.

												<h3>Machine Course Final Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												For the final project of the machine learning course (Fall 2021) I implemented a feature extraction (both time-domain and frequency-domain) and model selection pipeline for a dataset, consisting of EEG samples. Implemetation was done using the scikit-learn library. The goal was to figure out during the recording the test EEG signal, what specific word was shown to the subject.

												<h3>Advanced Programming Final Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												For the final project of the advanced programming course (Spring 2020) We implemented a graphic-based software to get a electric circuit as input and computes all currents and voltages for each element and each time-step. Implemntation was done using Java language and the Swing library for the graphics.
